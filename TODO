In the vul_image.hpp the && operator is set as default explicitly, but it is implicitly deleted because member variable m_vulDevice is a reference. Fix this

The ImGuiImages always use the frameIndex 0 image, regardless of the current frameIndex. Figure out if that is a problem and change if so

Actually, figure out if this whole 2 frames in flight thing is working at all.

In the vulkano_program.cpp I always wait for the gpu to become idle after telling it to render. Figure out if this is necessary and if not, how much does it really slow down

Move some stuff out ouf the vul_settings.hpp.

Revamp the objects system, such as the getObjectsPointer

Refine the screen object system such as the vertices used for it and the underlying graphichs pipeline
